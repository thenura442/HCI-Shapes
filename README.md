# HCI Shape Learner

This project entails the development of a sophisticated monitoring system for fish tanks leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The system is designed to provide comprehensive insights into the fish tank environment, ensuring optimal conditions for aquatic life. The system operates autonomously, continuously collecting data from the sensors placed within the fish tank. This data is then processed and analyzed to provide valuable insights into the fish tank environment, without requiring constant human intervention.
